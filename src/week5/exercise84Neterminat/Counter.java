public class Counter {
//    Make a class Counter that holds a number that can be decreased and increased.
//    The counter also has an optional check that prevents the counter from going below 0.
//    The class has to have the following constructors:
//
        public Counter(int startingValue, boolean check)
//    creates a new counter with the given value.
//    The check is on if the parameter given to check was true.
//    public Counter(int startingValue) creates a new counter with the given value. The check on the new counter should be off.
//    public Counter(boolean check) creates a new counter with the starting value 0. The check is on if the parameter given to check was true.
//    public Counter() creates a new counter with the starting value of 0 and with checking off.
//    and the following methods:
//
//    public int value() returns the current value of the counter
//    public void increase() increases the value of the counter by one
//    public void decrease() decreases the value of the counter by one, but not below 0 if the check is on
